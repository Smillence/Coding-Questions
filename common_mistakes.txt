1. use dot "." to access class member, not "->"
2. be careful with '/' operator if you want to get float result
3. missing return statement
4. append element to a linked list needs to keep track of the tail or you will always
end up with setting head.next so the list will alway be of size 2
5. forloop does not work for linked list
6. linked list questions usually need two variables: head and cur
